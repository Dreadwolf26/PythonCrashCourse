You can walk outside and listen to all kinds of talk, get told that you're a god or a total bastard. \
The Iron will always kick you the real deal. The Iron is the great reference point, the all-knowing perspective giver.\ Always there like a beacon in the pitch black. \
I have found the Iron to be my greatest friend. \
It never freaks out on me, never runs. Friends may come and go. But two hundred pounds is always two hundred pounds."
